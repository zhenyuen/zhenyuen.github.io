## Introduction

Hi there! Not too sure what I should write for my first blog post(?) It's 2am here, and I have just finished setting up my personal website. The goal of having this blog is to provide some insight and thoughts into my academic interests, e.g., computer systems, information theory, machine learning and quantitative finance.

Ideally, I would love to dedicate my time to my blog and website. However, I am pretty occupied with exam preparations and job applications currently. There's still lots of work to be done here. In time, I hope to improve the website and provide various educational materials for my fellow readers! Stay tuned :)

**P.S. the next section is just me experimenting with LaTeX and the [MathJax 3 engine](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html).**

## Equations

One of my all-time favorite formula - the Taylor's Expansion. From approximating asymptotic behaviour of unbounded systems to [Quake's fast inverse square root algorithm](https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-quakes-fast-inverse-square-root/), you can't deny its significance in simplifying computations for most practical applications.

$$
f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty f^{(k)}(a)\frac{(x-a)^k}{k!}
$$
