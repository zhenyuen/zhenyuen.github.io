Implemented a simple face recognition system for multiple users using OpenCV and runs on Raspberry Pi with a connected camera module. Face detection is implemented using a pre-trained cascade classifier from OpenCV in Python. Here's a [short clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fucjsEZCop8) of it in operation.
