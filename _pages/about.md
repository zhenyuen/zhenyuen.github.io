Hi there. I am Zhen Yuen, a penultimate year undergraduate majoring in computer engineering and information theory with a minor in Finance under the [HKU-Cambridge Joint Recruitment Scheme](https://engg.hku.hk/Teaching-Learning/BEng-BASc/HKU-Cambridge-Undergraduate-Recruitment-Scheme).

Currently, I am employed as a part-time undergraduate at [ARM Ltd](https://www.arm.com) under the GPU Build Systems and DevOps division. For my undergraduate thesis at the HKU, I proposed and designed various algorithms for video reconstruction in Snapshot Compressive Imaging based on score-based generative models, and was awarded the HKU Teaching Development and Language Enhancement Grant (TDLEG).

There is still plenty of work to be done with my website, so stay tuned :)
