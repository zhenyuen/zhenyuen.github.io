Hi there. I am Zhen Yuen, an incoming final year undergraduate majoring in computer engineering and information theory with a minor in Finance under the [HKU-Cambridge Joint Recruitment Scheme](https://engg.hku.hk/Teaching-Learning/BEng-BASc/HKU-Cambridge-Undergraduate-Recruitment-Scheme). My undergraduate thesis at HKU was titled Solving Inverse Problems in Compressive Imaging with Score-Based Generative Models, which was recently accepted (pending release) by the [10th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA' 2023)](https://conferences.sigappfr.org/dsaa2023/) and was awarded the HKU Teaching Development and Language Enhancement Grant (TDLEG). I am looking forward to working on [LÃ©vy State Space models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12524) for object tracking and implementing them in the open-source Stone Soup framework as my final year project at the University of Cambridge.

Currently, I am employed at [Visa](https://www.visa.co.uk) as an software engineering intern in the Open VisaNet (OVN) Tools team, where I am responsible for building various tools to assist our developers at OVN. One example is a self-hosted, scalable LLM chatbot service equipped with internal developer documentations as its primary knowledge base. Previously, I was an part-time undergraduate at [ARM Ltd](https://www.arm.com) under the GPU Build Systems and DevOps division. 

My academic interests includes computer hardware, low-level software and optimization, machine learning and quantitative finance. There is still plenty of work to be done with my website, so stay tuned :)
