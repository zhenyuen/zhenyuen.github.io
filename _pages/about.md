Hi there. I am Zhen Yuen, an incoming final year undergraduate majoring in computer engineering and information theory with a minor in Finance under the [HKU-Cambridge Joint Recruitment Scheme](https://engg.hku.hk/Teaching-Learning/BEng-BASc/HKU-Cambridge-Undergraduate-Recruitment-Scheme). For my undergraduate thesis at the HKU, I proposed and designed various algorithms for video reconstruction in Snapshot Compressive Imaging based on score-based generative models, and was awarded the HKU Teaching Development and Language Enhancement Grant (TDLEG). I am looking forward to working on [LÃ©vy State Space models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12524) for object tracking and implementing them in the open-source Stone Soup framework as my final year project at Cambridge.

Currently, I am employed at [Visa](https://www.visa.co.uk) as an software engineering intern in the Open VisaNet (OVN) Tools team, where I am responsible for building various tools to assist our developers at OVN. One example is a self-hosted, scalable LLM chatbot service equipped with internal developer documentations as its primary knowledge base. Previously, I was an part-time undergraduate at [ARM Ltd](https://www.arm.com) under the GPU Build Systems and DevOps division. 

My academic interests includes machine learning and quantitative finance. There is still plenty of work to be done with my website, so stay tuned :)
